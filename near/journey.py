    Data was acquired from Flipside Crypto's NEAR tables.
    Crosschain data is based off of previous analysis (see [here](https://ltirrell-flipside-bounties-nearcitizens-of-near-users-xtxglz.streamlitapp.com/)), using the following queries:
    """
    for k, v in near_info.query_information.items():
        x = f"- [{k}]({v['query']})"

    The `transaction` table from each of the chains was used, counting the equivalent of a `tx_id` as a unique transaction, and `from_address` or `signer` as a user.

    The query used for the Rainbow bridge section was heavily influenced by [excellent work](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/the-rainbow-bridge-Ai9j6g) from Discord user `mhm#1465`, as well as discussions with [@pinehearst_](https://twitter.com/pinehearst_)ğŸŒ².

We want examine how users interact with the [**NEAR** blockchain](https://near.org/) and compare it to usage of several other popular blockchains:
- Ethereum
- Solana (only looking at the past 30 days)
- Algorand
- Polygon

This analysis will focus on data from the past **90 days**.

We'll look at 3 types of users:
- **All Users**: Addresses which have made at any time during our analysis period (90 days)
- **Active Users**: Addresses which have made a transaction in the past **30 days**
- **Inactive Users**: Addresses which have made a transaction in the past 90 days, but have **not** made a transaction in the past 30 days

"Users" in all cases are addresses which sign a transaction, with no attempt to separate smart contracts or other non-human address type from actual human users.


Active users are still interacting on their respective blockchains regardless of the market conditions.
Inactive users, on the other hand, have stopped their activity over the last month as sentiments are more bearish or unpredictable.
